| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Web Service Functions (_3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 2 API calls seen, generally implemented correctly in terms of just the API call | 35 | Missing 1 API call |
| **Web App Layout (_2b_, _3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Straightforward interface, fairly intuitive; some guide to acceptable stock and cryptocurrency symbols would have been useful though. Also, because of the degree of delay in getting the ticker to show up, some “loading” feedback would have been helpful there. | 25 | Need better UI guidance for valid stock and cryptocurrency ticker symbols; need feedback while ticker is loading |
| **Test Suite (_4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 8 successes out of 8 tests<br><br>**Statements** 33/34 (97.06%)<br>**Branches** 3/6 (50.00%)<br>**Functions** 0/0 (100.00%)<br>**Lines** 31/32 (96.88%) | 18 | Need tests for cases where errors are encountered (i.e., `results[‘Error Message’] !== undefined`)
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | no errors |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 26 commits |  |  |
