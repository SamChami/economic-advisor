# Description

This application takes the [Alphavantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/) to gracefully display information about stock and currency, as well as displays relevant Bloomberg news using the [News API](https://newsapi.org)

To run the application, you can use your localhost:8000 by running the following:

Python 2
> $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Python 3
> $ python -m http.server

## A test suite can be run via NPM:
```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

Note that currently, Navs in Bootstrap 4 sometimes act strangely with heavy JavaScript use within the tabs.
